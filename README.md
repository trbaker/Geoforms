# Geoforms for use with Google Drive (2012-2015)
The ColdFusion code for the EdGIS GeoForms Tool for use with Google Drive.  This was created ~2012. The code has had username, passwords, and servers removed but otherwise intact. 

Script written under ColdFuison 7 but should work under current versions. See www.adobel.com/coldfusion

I no longer have a copy of this script running on a server however you can get a free local/developer ColdFusion server.
